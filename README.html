<p>AFINCH</p>

<h1>AFINCH (Analysis of Flow in Networks of Channels)</h1>

<ul>
<li>AFINCH is a computer application designed to generate time series of monthly flows at stream segments (flowlines) and corresponding water yields at catchments defined in the National Hydrography Dataset (NHDPlus, v. 2).<br/></li>
<li>AFINCH provides a basis for integrating monthly flow data from streamgages, water-use data, monthly climatic data, land-cover characteristics defined in NHDPlus, and catchment attributes described in user-defined shapefiles to estimate natural monthly water yields from catchments.</li>
<li>AFINCH provides an interactive process for the user to develop sets of multiple-regression equations for estimating monthly water yields.<br/>

<ul>
<li>Images of monthly water yields for active streamgages are generated in AFINCH and provide a basis for detecting anomalies in water yields, which may be associated with undocumented flow diversions or augmentations.<br/></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Water yields are multiplied by the drainage areas of the corresponding catchments to estimate monthly flows.<br/></li>
<li>Flows from catchments are accumulated downstream through the streamflow network described by the stream segments.<br/>

<ul>
<li>For stream segments where streamgages are active, ratios of measured to accumulated flows are computed.<br/></li>
<li>These ratios are applied to upstream water yields to proportionally constrain estimated flows to match measured flows.<br/></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A time series of monthly flows can be generated for stream segments that average about 1-mile long, or monthly water yields from catchments that average about 1 square mile.<br/>

<ul>
<li>Chloropleth maps of monthly water yield and flow can be generated and analyzed.<br/></li>
<li>Estimated monthly flows can be displayed within AFINCH, examined for nonstationarity, and tested for monotonic trends.<br/></li>
<li>Monthly flows also can be used to estimate flow-duration characteristics at stream segments within AFINCH.<br/></li>
</ul></li>
<li>AFINCH generates output files of monthly flows and water yields that are that can be used for specialized analyses.<br/></li>
<li>AFINCH conserves through the NHDPlus network.<br/></li>
<li>Matlab code used in the AFINCH application is included in the repository starting with version 3a. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to AFINCH: version: AFinchGUI3b.m</h2>

<h3>summary:</h3>

<ul>
<li>write out design matrix and regression coefficients to text files so that climate change 
     scenarios can be run efficiently by replacing the climate variables in the design 
     matrix with desired values and multiplying the design matrix and the vector
     of regression coefficients.  This multiplication yields the unconstrained incremental 
     square root catchment yields which are used to estimate the unconstrained incremental 
     flows for each catchment.  One file with a design matrix and one file with regression 
     coefficients are written for each month. Only period-of-analysis, ordinary least-squares, 
     values are written. </li>
</ul>

<h3>changes:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>AFinchGUI3b.m, added code from lines 593 - 627 to fill a design matrix
     including a gridcode column and write it to files by month. The
     files are DesMat_mon.csv, where mon is an abbreviated month name. Also write
     the regression coefficient information to b_vec_mon.csv where mon 
     is the abbreviated month name. Code was added to get the current water
     year given the iy counter for the calculation (WY = WY1 + iy - 1) and
     to use this information in the AFdaysInMonth script.  The vector
     DaysInMo in version GUI3a was not updating with water year and 
     was replaced.</p></li>
<li><p>AFdaysInMonth.m, this script was added to get return the number of
     days in each month considering leapyear given the computation month
     and water year.  Used in AFinchGUI3b.m in the estimate of incremental
     flow from a catchment. </p></li>
<li><p>AFSetupData.m, the vector DaysInMo was moved later in the code and kept internal to this script.
      It had been written to application memory to be used in AFinchGUI, but this vector was removed.<br/>
      AFdaysInMonth.m replaces this vector.</p></li>
</ul>
